# Media-Streaming-using-Socket-Programming
In this project we have developed a socket programming model for streaming video and audio. Our model supports
two kinds of functionalities which include streaming a video
and live webcam stream. Streaming a video with audio basically
means the server system transfers a video to the client system
and they can view the stream. In live streaming, a cache server
exists, in which multiple clients will be able to access the live
stream. The backbone of the entire data transfer system is socket
programming as data transfer done here uses packets which are
sent out by the server and received by the client using sockets.
